🌱 Eco-Footprint Advisor
Eco-Footprint Advisor is an AI-powered web application that predicts a user's weekly carbon footprint (CO₂ emissions) based on lifestyle habits like transport usage, energy consumption, diet, and waste behavior.

🛠 Tech Stack
1. Machine Learning: Random Forest Regressor (scikit-learn)

2. Model Accuracy: ~87% R² score on test data

3. Backend: Python, Flask

4. Frontend: HTML/CSS (via Flask templates)

5. Model Deployment: Pickle (joblib)

6. Libraries Used: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Flask

🔍 How It Works
1. User enters weekly lifestyle data via a web form.

2. The data is passed to a trained Linear Regression model.

3. The model predicts the estimated CO₂ emission in kilograms.

4. Result is displayed on the same page with a meaningful message.

🌍 Impact
1. Environmental Awareness: Helps users understand their carbon footprint and make eco-friendly choices.

2. Educational Use: Can be integrated into workshops or learning tools for sustainability.

3. Business Use: Extendable for green audits, ESG reports, and employee carbon tracking.

🚀 Future Scope
1. User authentication with history tracking

2. Personalized tips to reduce emissions

3. Interactive dashboards with visual insights

4. REST API and mobile app integration

5. Model upgrade (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
