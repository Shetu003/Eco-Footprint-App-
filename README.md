🌱 Eco-Footprint Advisor
Eco-Footprint Advisor is an AI-powered web application that predicts a user's weekly carbon footprint (CO₂ emissions) based on lifestyle habits like transport usage, energy consumption, diet, and waste behavior.

🛠 Tech Stack
Machine Learning: Linear Regression (scikit-learn)

Model Accuracy: ~87% R² score on test data

Backend: Python, Flask

Frontend: HTML/CSS (via Flask templates)

Model Deployment: Pickle (joblib)

Libraries Used: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Flask

🔍 How It Works
User enters weekly lifestyle data via a web form.

The data is passed to a trained Linear Regression model.

The model predicts the estimated CO₂ emission in kilograms.

Result is displayed on the same page with a meaningful message.

🌍 Impact
Environmental Awareness: Helps users understand their carbon footprint and make eco-friendly choices.

Educational Use: Can be integrated into workshops or learning tools for sustainability.

Business Use: Extendable for green audits, ESG reports, and employee carbon tracking.

🚀 Future Scope
User authentication with history tracking

Personalized tips to reduce emissions

Interactive dashboards with visual insights

REST API and mobile app integration

Model upgrade (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
